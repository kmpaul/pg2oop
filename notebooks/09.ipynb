    "\n",
    "Another good example of a use for classes is when you have *multiple* functions that have *similar, complicated* signatures.  A *signature* is the collection of arguments that get passed into the function.  If you have *one, single function* with many required arguments, you might want to consider splitting the function up into multiple functions that are smaller and less complicated to call.  If you have *many functions*, each with the same required arguments, you might want to consider grouping those functions into a class and making the common arguments in all of your functions class data.\n",

Maybe it's just measuring local properties of some \"environment,\" whatever you want to call it.

Hence, *conceptually*, the data and the computations (i.e., functions) are (*again*) intrinsically related to one another!\n",
