    "## Complicated Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "One good example of a use for classes and objects is when you have complicated data structures.  What makes a data structure complicated?  Well, think about it from the user's point of view.  If the user can't simply `print(data)` and understand what the data is and how to use it from the output, then it's complicated.  Obviously, there are varying degrees of complicated, but the data should be simple to access and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example.  Imagine that you have a large number of *instruments* that record a large number of different kinds of data with irregular temporal frequencies.  Imagine that the *instrument* records each variable at different times, so there is no time data common to all variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the data is potentially numerous and varied, there are usually many ways of *representing* the data.  One way of representing this kind of data is with nested lists, tuples, and dictionaries.  Since the data record frequencies are irregular, and each variable has it's own time data, it makes some sense to group the time and variable data *together* in a `tuple`, and then store multiple time-variable `tuples` in a `list`.  Then, we can store each time-variable `tuple-list` in a `dict` with the name of each variable as the key in the dictionary.  This might look like the following."
