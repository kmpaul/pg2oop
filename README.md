<b>Note:</b>
<p>For those of you who have been following along with our Python Tutorial Seminars, you
may have already taken the previous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEFnL8C62u8&t=11s">Object Oriented Programming</a> tutorial.  That's fine!  This tutorial a different take on much of the
same content.  If you've attended or watched the previous OOP tutorial, and you are still
a little confused about OOP and <em>how to use it on a daily basis</em>, then this tutorial may
help.  If you didn't attend or watch the previous OOP tutorial, that's fine, too.  This
tutorial is meant to be a stand-alone OOP tutorial presenting the material from a <em>practical</em>
point of view.  If this tutorial doesn't completely satisfy you, then feel free to go back
and watch the first OOP tutorial again (or for the first time).</p>
